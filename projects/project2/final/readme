Project 2
Hummam Houara

LOFI vinyl Player
  The vision behind this project is to make a visually pleasing online music player, the reason behind
it is to just play the vinyl record in the background while the user is reading/studying etc.
The user is able to interact through multiple ways, for example,  placing stickers turning on and off the vinyl,
going to the next or previous song, and shuffling.

since we were allowed to use web development languages for this project, i was able to make the design
pretty eye comfortable since it is a way of playing the calming songs.

The libraries that were used are jquery and jquery UI.

All the songs, covers are made by lofi music.
