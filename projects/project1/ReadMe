 The dark knight audio player, Hummam Houara
 The user choses between batman and the joker then the user will be able to adjust the volume of three aspects
 the soundtrack, the sound effects and the script.
 this should give the user an experience of the movie without necessarily watching it. they can
 understand both sides of the movie by analyzing the audio concept.
An edit of each character will also be played to give the user some visualization.

i used the P5 and the annyang library.
Some of my code was also inspired by some examples from the documentation of the P5 library.
